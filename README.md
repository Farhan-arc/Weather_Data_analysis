# 🌦️ Weather Dataset Analysis Using Pandas

Welcome to my Weather Dataset Analysis project!  
This project is part of my data analysis portfolio and demonstrates my skills in **data wrangling**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **insight generation** using Python and the Pandas library.

---

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of a time-series weather dataset by leveraging **Pandas** for data manipulation and uncovering meaningful trends and insights from raw data.

---

## 🔍 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes key weather parameters such as:

- 🌡️ Temperature  
- 🌫️ Dew Point Temperature  
- 💧 Relative Humidity  
- 🌬️ Wind Speed  
- 👁️ Visibility  
- 📉 Atmospheric Pressure  
- ☁️ General Weather Conditions

## 📊 Project Highlights

### 🧹 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Identified and handled missing/null values.
- Standardized column names for consistency.
- Converted data types to appropriate formats for analysis.

### 📈 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Descriptive statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation).
- Trend analysis across temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- Time-based distribution of weather conditions.

### 🔍 3. Conditional Filtering
- Queried data for specific weather conditions like “Clear”, “Snow”, and “Fog”.
- Filtered visibility and wind speed ranges for pattern recognition.

### 📊 4. Grouped Aggregations
- Grouped by weather condition to calculate:
  - Average temperature  
  - Min/Max humidity  
  - Wind speed variations

## 💻 Technical Implementation

The entire analysis was performed using **Jupyter Notebook** with the following tools:

### Tools & Libraries:
- `Pandas` – for data manipulation and cleaning
- `NumPy` – for numerical computations (optional)
