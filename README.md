**🌦️ Weather Dataset Analysis Using Pandas**

<div align="Left">

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a time-series weather dataset using **Pandas**.
The dataset captures key weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility. 
The goal is to derive meaningful insights and showcase the power of **data manipulation** 
and **exploratory data analysis(EDA)**.

**🔍 Project Overview**

This project provides a detailed analysis of weather conditions, focusing on:

🌡️ Temperature

🌫️ Dew Point Temperature

💧 Relative Humidity

🌬️ Wind Speed

👁️ Visibility

📉 Pressure

☁️ General Weather Conditions




**📊 Key Highlights**

**1. 🧹 Data Cleaning & Exploration**

Identified and managed missing values.

Performed data type conversions and renamed columns for consistency.

**2. 📈 Descriptive Statistics**

Derived insights from mean, variance, and standard deviation for different weather attributes.

Examined the distribution of weather parameters across time.

**3. 🔍 Conditional Queries**

Filtered specific weather patterns such as "Clear" weather, particular wind speeds, and visibility
ranges for further analysis.

**4. 📊 Aggregated Insights**

Grouped data by weather conditions to reveal **mean, minimum, and maximum** values for variables 
like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.


**💻 Code Breakdown**

Displayed dataset summaries (first & last records,column names, data types).

Handled missing data and performed **data cleaning** (renaming columns, data type adjustments).

Calculated key statistics: **mean, variance, and standard deviation.**

Applied **conditional queries** to filter weather patterns(e.g., clear, fog, snow).

Grouped and aggregated data to reveal patterns and trends in the dataset.


**🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used**

***Pandas***: For data manipulation and analysis.

***NumPy*** (optional): For additional numerical operations.


**🏁 Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how effective data analysis techniques can extract actionable insights from weather data.
The analysis can be expanded into predictive modeling and other machine learning applications,
serving as a foundation for more advanced data science projects.


**🚀 Next Steps:**

Expand the analysis to predict future weather conditions.

Apply **machine learning models** for weather forecasting.


This project showcases my **data manipulation**, **problem-solving**, and **data analysis** skills using **Pandas**.
By analyzing real-world weather data, I aim to demonstrate the ability to derive meaningful insights 
from raw datasets.
